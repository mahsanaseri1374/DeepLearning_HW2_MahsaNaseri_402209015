CrossEntropyLoss (`torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss`)\n","- **Description:** Combines `LogSoftmax` and `NLLLoss` in one single class.

The function minimizes the negative log-probability assigned to the correct class, effectively penalizing predictions that deviate from the true class, making it a standard choice for classification tasks in deep learning.\n","\n","Now, let's implement a class called `SimpleMLP_Loss` that has the following

KLDivLoss (`torch.nn.KLDivLoss`)\n","- **Description:** Kullback-Leibler Divergence Loss measures how one probability distribution diverges from a second, reference distribution.

This penalty discourages the model from becoming too complex, ensuring better generalization to unseen data. In this notebook, you will explore the concepts of regularization, understand different types of regularization techniques, and apply them using Python's popular libraries.\n","\n","## What is Regularization?\n","\n","Regularization involves adding a regularization term to the loss function used to train machine learning models. This term imposes a constraint on the model's coefficients, effectively reducing their magnitude. By doing so, regularization helps in:\n","\n","- **Preventing Overfitting:** Ensures the model does not become too tailored to the training data.\n","- **Improving Generalization:** Enhances the model's performance on new, unseen data.\n","- **Feature Selection:** Especially in L1 regularization, it can drive some coefficients to zero, effectively selecting important features.\n","\n","## Types of Regularization\n","\n","There are several types of regularization techniques, each imposing different constraints on the model's parameters:\n","\n","### 1. L1 Regularization (Lasso)\n","\n","L1 regularization adds the absolute value of the magnitude of coefficients as a penalty term to the loss function. It can lead to sparse models where some feature coefficients are exactly zero.\n","\n","### 2. L2 Regularization (Ridge)\n","\n","L2 regularization adds the squared magnitude of coefficients as a penalty term to the loss function. It tends to shrink the coefficients evenly but does not set them to zero.\n","\n","### 3. Elastic Net\n","\n","Elastic Net combines both L1 and L2 regularization penalties. It balances the benefits of both Lasso and Ridge methods, allowing for feature selection and coefficient shrinkage."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"XNXwbwndd6kL"},"source":["## Homework Time!\n","Import Iris dataset from sklearn.datasets and apply ridge regression with different alpha values.
